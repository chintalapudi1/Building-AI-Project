# AI Watch Recommender

Final project for the Building AI course

# Summary

This AI helps users find their ideal watch by analyzing their preferences, such as watch shape, type (analog or digital), price range, style, and other preferences. By leveraging machine learning and user input, the system provides personalized recommendations, making watch shopping simpler and more enjoyable.

# Background

Finding the perfect watch can be overwhelming due to the vast number of choices available. Users often struggle to match their preferences with the right product, leading to frustration or suboptimal purchases. This AI aims to solve this issue by offering a personalized approach to watch shopping, aligning functionality, style, and budget to usersâ€™ unique needs.

# How is it used?

This AI can be used by anyone shopping for a watch, whether for personal use or as a gift. Users provide their criteria through a website or app, and the AI generates recommendations based on these preferences. Retailers can also implement this system on their platforms to provide a better customer experience and improve sales.

# Data sources and AI methods

The AI will utilize data from watch catalogs, user reviews, and sales data from popular retailers and online marketplaces such as Ashford.com, Amazon, and other watch-focused websites. Techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) will interpret user inputs, while collaborative and content-based filtering algorithms will generate recommendations. Over time, the system will improve its accuracy by learning from user interactions and preferences.

# Challenges

Challenges include acquiring diverse and high-quality datasets and ensuring unbiased recommendations. The AI may also face difficulties addressing extremely niche preferences or rare models. Additionally, user input accuracy will significantly affect the quality of recommendations, which could be a limitation in some cases.

# What next?

To enhance this AI, future developments could include features like augmented reality to let users visualize watches on their wrists, integrating voice-based search, and expanding the system to include pre-owned and luxury watch markets. These advancements would make the AI more versatile and appealing to a broader audience.
